# 1.What motivated me to join the Data Analysis Track?
I decided to join the Data Analysis Track because I plan to transfer to a data-related major next January. I believe that learning the fundamental concepts and skills in advance will help me better understand my courses and achieve higher grades. To prepare for academic success, I chose to participate in this track.
